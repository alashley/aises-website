# aises-website
Website for MIT's student chapter of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society
	
  
Hello HTML editor for MIT AISES or a wandering web developer!
	
Interested in learning what our site uses and how it works?
	
Welcome to the home page tutorial/readme, where we teach you about how our specifc
framework and javascript thingamajigs! We hope that you know at least basic HTML, so we 
do not need to explain how headers work and such, but we will talk about any specific 
structure or techniques used that might be hard to see initially.

Our site is a basic HTML constructed site with a YAML framework. You can find the 
various different classes on the YAML website: http://www.yaml.de.

If you are looking for specific things to work on, here are a few suggestions for 
improving the website:
1) Make a dedicated mobile version?
2) A better photo display system?
3) MIT student/alum-only area?

Have fun developing!
